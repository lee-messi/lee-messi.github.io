The preprint of my new paper "[Vision-Language Models Represent Darker-Skinned Black Individuals as More Homogeneous than Lighter-Skinned Black Individuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09668)" is now available on ArXiv. We find that state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models represent darker-skinned Black individuals as more homogeneous than lighter-skinned Black individuals, consistent with human patterns of stereotyping.
