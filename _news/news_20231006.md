I won the [3MT (3 Minute Thesis) Competition](https://mcdonnell.washu.edu/about/history/symposium/2023-symposium/) at the Global Research Symposium hosted by the McDonnell International Scholars Academy. I was awarded both the First Place Award and the People's Choice Award of the Digital Transformation Track.
