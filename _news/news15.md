The preprint of my new paper "[More Distinctively Black and Feminine Faces Lead to Increased Stereotyping in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06194)" is now available on ArXiv. We find that distinctively Black and feminine faces are subject to greater streotyping in Vision Language Models.
