The preprint of my new article "[More Distinctively Black and Feminine Faces Lead to Increased Stereotyping in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06194)" has been made available on ArXiv. In this paper, we find that distinctively Black and feminine faces are subject to greater streotyping in VLMs.
