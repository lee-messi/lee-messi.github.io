The preprint of my new article "[More Distinctively Black and Feminine Faces Lead to Increased Stereotyping in Vision-Language Models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381473768_More_Distinctively_Black_and_Feminine_Faces_Lead_to_Increased_Stereotyping_in_Vision-Language_Models)" has been made available on ResearchGate. In the paper, we find that distinctively Black and feminine faces are subject to greater streotyping in VLMs.
