I'm officially Dr. Lee now! I successfully defended my dissertation titled "Stereotyping in Language (Technologies): An Examination of Racial and Gender Stereotypes in Natural Language and Language Models." You can watch my dissertation defense [here](https://youtu.be/KomL7MuhOcc?si=xznXccnbZ4WsWUi7). Thanks to everyone who supported me along this journey!
