I'm thrilled to announce that I am officially Dr. Lee now! I successfully defended my dissertation titled "Stereotyping in Language (Technologies): An Examination of Racial and Gender Stereotypes in Natural Language and Language Models." If you'd like to see how it all went down, you can watch the recorded defense [here](https://youtu.be/KomL7MuhOcc?si=xznXccnbZ4WsWUi7). Thanks to everyone who supported me along this journey!
