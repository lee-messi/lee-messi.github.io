The pre-print of my new paper "[Implicit Bias-Like Patterns in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572)" is now available on ArXiv. We find that reasoning models (i.e., o3-mini) consume substantially more reasoning tokens when processing association-incompatible information compared to association-compatible information. This pattern parallels the delayed response times humans exhibit when processing association-incompatible information in the Implicit Association Test (IAT).
