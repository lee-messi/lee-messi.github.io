The pre-print of my new paper "[Visual Cues of Gender and Race are Associated with Stereotyping in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05093)" is now available on ArXiv. We find that gender prototypicality is linked to greater homogeneity of group representations in VLM-generated texts.
