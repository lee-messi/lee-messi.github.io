The preprint of my new paper "[Examining the Robustness of Homogeneity Bias to Hyperparameter Adjustments in GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02211)" is now available on ArXiv. We find that homogeneity bias in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)–their tendency to represent marginalized racial and gender groups as more homogeneous than their dominant group counterparts–is robust to hyperparameters modulations.
