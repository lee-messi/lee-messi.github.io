The pre-print of my new paper [Probability of Differentiation Reveals Brittleness of Homogeneity Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07329) was made available on ArXiv. Check it out! We find that homogeneity bias, as measured by probability of differentation, is brittle in Large Language Models.
