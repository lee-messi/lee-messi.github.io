I published my very first blog post about my research on homogeneity bias in AI. You can find it on my website as [a blog entry](https://lee-messi.github.io/blog/2025/homogeneity-bias/) or you can read it as [a LinkedIn Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/homogeneity-bias-large-language-models-messi-lee-qe5kc/?trackingId=oR%2FGaBxgT2G6Tvhc%2FT9YMQ%3D%3D).
