The pre-print of my new paper "[Homogeneity Bias as Differential Sampling Uncertainty in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19337)" is now available on ArXiv. We find that that certain Vision-Language Models exhibit significantly more deterministic token sampling patterns when processing marginalized groups compared to dominant groups. This finding suggests a potential mechanism underlying homogeneity bias in language models.
