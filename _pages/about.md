I'm a fourth year PhD Candidate in the [Division of Computational and Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I am part of the Psychological & Brain Sciences Track, doing research at the [Diversity Science Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/calvinlai/). My advisors are [Calvin K. Lai](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/calvin-lai) in the Psychological & Brain Sciences Department and [Jacob M. Montgomery](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/jacob-montgomery) in the Political Sciences Track. 

My research is at the intersection of Social Psychology and Artifical Intelligence where I study bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, I've been working on projects assessing [homogeneity bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08495) in LLMs where we find that these models portray socially subordinate groups as more homogeneous compared to their dominant counterparts. Moving forward, I aim to develop strategies to mitigate this bias, enhancing the fairness and inclusivity of AI systems.
