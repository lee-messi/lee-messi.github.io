Hi! I'm Messi H.J. Lee. In May of 2025, I completed my PhD in Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). During my PhD, I was adivsed by two amazing advisors–[Calvin K. Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nkkrs_YAAAAJ) in the Department of Psychology at Rutgers University and [Jacob M. Montgomery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GaWC-J4AAAAJ) in the Political Sciences Department at WashU.

My research focuses on the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and social psychology where I evaluate stereotyping in AI models. I recently completed work looking at [implicit bias in reasoning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572) where we discover that reasoning models require significantly more computational resources to process association-incompatible information (e.g., men-family & women-career) compared to association-compatible information (e.g., men-career & women-family). This finding suggests that even advanced AI systems exhibit processing patterns analogous to human implicit bias.

I am currently in South Korea fulfilling my military service obligation as a technical research personnel (전문연구요원) developing AI models for pathology and doing research related to bias in pathology-related AI models. If you would like collaborate on topics related to AI bias and stereotyping, feel free to reach out to me at hojunlee1012[at]gmail[dot]com.
