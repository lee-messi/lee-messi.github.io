I'm a fifth year PhD Candidate in the [Division of Computational and Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). I am part of the Psychological & Brain Sciences Track, doing research at the Diversity Science Lab. My advisors are [Calvin K. Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nkkrs_YAAAAJ) in the Department of Psychology at Rutgers University and [Jacob M. Montgomery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GaWC-J4AAAAJ) in the Political Sciences Department at WashU.

My research focuses on applying text-as-data methodologies to measure stereotyping in Large- and Vision-Language Models. Recently, I've shifted my attention to measuring [implicit bias in reasoning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572). In this work, we discovered that reasoning models require significantly more computational resources to process association-incompatible pairings (e.g., men-family & women-career) compared to association-compatible ones (e.g., men-career & women-family). This finding suggests that even advanced AI systems exhibit processing patterns analogous to human implicit bias.

After completing my PhD in May of 2025, I intend to fulfill my military service obligation in South Korea as a Technical Research Personnel (전문연구요원), preferably continuing research in the areas of AI Bias and Computational Social Science. If there are any relevant opportunities I should know about, please feel free to send me an email at: hojunlee[at]wustl[dot]edu.
