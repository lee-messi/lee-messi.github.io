I'm a fifth year PhD Candidate in the [Division of Computational and Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). I am part of the Psychological & Brain Sciences Track, doing research at the [Diversity Science Lab](https://calvinklai.com/). My advisors are [Calvin K. Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nkkrs_YAAAAJ) in the Department of Psychology at Rutgers University and [Jacob M. Montgomery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GaWC-J4AAAAJ) in the Political Sciences Department at WashU.

My research primarily focuses on using text-as-data approaches to measure bias in AI technologies such as Large Language and Multimodal Models. Recently, I published a paper at the Proceedings of the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, studying [homogeneity bias in LLMs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3630106.3658975) where we find that these models portray socially subordinate groups as more homogeneous compared to their dominant group counterparts.

After completing my PhD in May of 2025, I intend to fulfill my military service obligation in South Korea as a Technical Research Personnel (전문연구요원), preferably continuing research in the areas of AI Bias, Computational Social Science, and Natural Language Processing. If there are any relevant opportunities I should know about, please feel free to send me an email at: hojunlee[at]wustl[dot]edu.
