I'm a fourth year PhD Candidate in the [Division of Computational and Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I am part of the Psychological & Brain Sciences Track, doing research at the [Diversity Science Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/calvinlai/). My advisors are [Calvin K. Lai](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/calvin-lai) in the Psychological & Brain Sciences Department and [Jacob M. Montgomery](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/jacob-montgomery) in the Political Sciences Department at WashU.

My research is at the intersection of Social Psychology and Artifical Intelligence where I study bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, I've been working on projects assessing [homogeneity bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08495) where we find that these models portray socially subordinate groups as more homogeneous compared to their dominant counterparts. Moving forward, I aim to develop strategies to mitigate this bias, enhancing the fairness and inclusivity of AI systems.

After completing my PhD in 2025, I intend to fulfill my military service obligation in South Korea as a Technical Research Personnel (전문연구요원), preferably continuing research on bias in Large Language Models. If there are any relevant opportunities I should know about, please feel free to contact me at: hojunlee@wustl.edu.
